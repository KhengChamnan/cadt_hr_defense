# Attendance Service Algorithms

## Total Working Hours Algorithm

### Data Organization:
- Attendance records are first grouped by date to process each day separately
- For each day, records are sorted chronologically by time

### Daily Calculation:
- Find the first check-in record for the day
- Find the last check-out record for the day
- Calculate working minutes = (check-out time - check-in time)
- This captures the full span from when an employee first arrives until they last leave

### Period Aggregation:
- Daily working minutes are summed up for the period (week/month/year)
- The total is converted to hours by dividing by 60

This approach accurately measures actual time between first arrival and last departure each day, rather than counting all individual check-ins and check-outs separately.

## Absent Hours Algorithm

### Workday Identification:
- Only weekdays (Monday to Friday) are considered as workdays
- Only days up to the current date are counted (not future days)

### Absence Detection:
- A set of dates with attendance records is created
- For each workday in the period, check if the date exists in this set
- If a workday has no attendance record, it's counted as absent

### Hours Calculation:
- Each absent day is multiplied by 8 hours (standard workday)
- Total absent hours = absent days Ã— 8

This ensures consistency across different time periods and properly accounts for weekends and future dates.

## Late Hours Algorithm

### Late Arrival Detection:
- For each day, find the first check-in record
- If check-in time is after 8:00 AM (480 minutes from midnight), it's considered late
- Late minutes = check-in time - 480 minutes

### Period Aggregation:
- Late minutes are summed up for all days in the period
- The total is converted to hours by dividing by 60

This tracks how many hours an employee arrived after the standard start time across the entire period.

All three algorithms work together to provide a comprehensive view of attendance patterns, work hours, and punctuality across different time periods in your application.
