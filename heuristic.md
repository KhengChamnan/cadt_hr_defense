---

## üéØ Step-by-Step Instruction

### 1. Understand the Course Goals

- Spot inefficiencies in the app's user flows.
- Analyze the app using **Jakob‚Äôs 10 Usability Heuristics**.
- Evaluate strengths and weaknesses in design.

> Only 7.88% of users stay after 30 days‚Äîusability matters!

---

### 2. Learn Key UX Design Concepts

Focus on how the product balances:

- **Business Goals** (What the company needs)
- **User Needs** (What the user expects)

Make sure the app supports:

- Accessibility
- Wireframes
- UI consistency
- Logical navigation (User Flows)
- Enjoyable UX

---

### 3. Evaluate UI & UX Relationship

Remember:

> **Good UI ‚â† Good UX**

Bad examples often include:
- Confusing layouts
- Unclear icons
- Unstructured navigation

---

### 4. Assess Usability Based on These 5 Questions:

Ask yourself:
1. Can users perform tasks easily the first time?
2. Is the app pleasant to use?
3. Do users make errors? Can they recover?
4. Do users remember how to use it?
5. Can they perform tasks quickly once learned?

---

### 5. Analyze Utility vs. Usability

Check:
- **Utility:** Does the app have needed features?
- **Usability:** Are those features easy to use?

---

### 6. Build & Review User Flows

Create user flows using this process:

1. Identify Use Cases (Ex: ‚ÄúOrder a Taxi‚Äù)
2. Prioritize them
3. Break them into Subtasks
4. Design wireframes/wireflows
5. Analyze & Optimize

Use tools like **Figma** or paper sketches.

### 7. Apply UX Strategy Rules

| If a task is...         | Then...                                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Very frequent           | Put it at first-level (easy access)                |
| Not frequent            | Hide in deeper levels (to reduce clutter)          |
| Very important          | Use badges, pop-ups                                |
| Very complex            | Break into simpler steps                           |
| Very stressful          | Offer autofill, error prevention, smooth UX       |

---

### 8. Analyze Example User Flows

Look for:
- Clear guidance for first-time users
- Minimal unnecessary steps
- Ability to go back or cancel
- Useful error messages

---

### 9. Activity: Jakob‚Äôs 10 Heuristics

#### Instructions:
1. Choose **1 of Jakob‚Äôs Heuristics**
2. Summarize it in your own words
3. Find **two visual examples**:
   - One where it‚Äôs used well
   - One where it‚Äôs violated
4. Propose a **short checklist (2‚Äì3 bullets)** to test for it

‚úÖ Example for ‚ÄúUser Control & Freedom‚Äù:
- Can users undo or cancel easily?
- Is there an exit path at each step?
