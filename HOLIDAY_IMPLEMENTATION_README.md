# Holiday Service Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds weekend holiday detection to the leave request system. The system now:

1. **Detects weekends (Saturday and Sunday) as holidays**
2. **Shows holiday conflicts when selecting dates**
3. **Calculates working days separately from total days**
4. **Does not deduct holiday hours from leave balances**

## Key Components

### 1. HolidayService (`lib/services/holiday_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Central service for holiday detection and calculations
- **Features**:
  - `isHoliday(DateTime date)` - Check if a date is a holiday
  - `calculateWorkingDays(start, end)` - Count working days excluding holidays
  - `analyzeRange(start, end)` - Get comprehensive analysis of a date range
  - `getHolidaysInRange(start, end)` - Get list of holidays in range

### 2. Enhanced Date Range Bottom Sheet
- **Visual indicators**: Holiday dates are highlighted with orange warning color
- **Holiday summary**: Shows count of weekends/holidays included in range
- **Working days calculation**: Displays both total days and working days

### 3. Updated Leave Selected Dates Header
- **Multiple chips**: Shows total days, working days, and holidays
- **Color coding**: Different colors for each type of information
- **Holiday awareness**: Automatically calculates and displays holiday impact

### 4. Enhanced Submit Process
- **Holiday analysis**: Logs holiday information during submission
- **Working days calculation**: Uses working days for leave balance deduction
- **Separation of concerns**: Holiday logic is isolated in the service

## Usage Examples

### Basic Holiday Check
```dart
// Check if a date is a holiday
bool isWeekend = HolidayService.isHoliday(DateTime(2025, 8, 23)); // Saturday = true

// Get working days in a range
int workingDays = HolidayService.calculateWorkingDays(
  DateTime(2025, 8, 21), // Thursday
  DateTime(2025, 8, 25), // Monday
); // Returns 3 (Thu, Fri, Mon - excluding Sat, Sun)
```

### Holiday Analysis
```dart
final analysis = HolidayService.analyzeRange(startDate, endDate);
print('Total days: ${analysis.totalDays}');
print('Working days: ${analysis.workingDays}');
print('Holidays: ${analysis.getHolidayNames()}');
```

## UI Changes

### Date Selection Calendar
- **Holiday highlighting**: Weekend dates show orange dot indicator
- **Color coding**: Holidays have light orange background
- **Visual feedback**: Clear distinction between working days and holidays

### Date Range Summary
- **Multi-chip display**: Total days (blue), Working days (green), Holidays (orange)
- **Comprehensive info**: Users see exactly what days are included
- **Interactive**: Tap to edit dates with full holiday awareness

## Configuration

### Current Holiday Rules
- **Weekends**: Saturday and Sunday are considered holidays
- **Extensible**: Service can be easily extended for:
  - Public holidays
  - Company-specific holidays
  - Regional holiday calendars
  - Custom holiday rules

### Future Enhancements
The service is designed to support:
- **Custom holiday calendars**
- **Regional holiday support**
- **Company-specific holiday rules**
- **Dynamic holiday configuration**

## Technical Details

### Working Days Calculation
- **Excludes weekends**: Only Monday-Friday count as working days
- **Leave balance**: Only working days are deducted from leave balance
- **Display clarity**: Both total and working days shown to user

### Performance
- **Efficient calculation**: Date iteration with early termination
- **Caching ready**: Structure supports future caching implementation
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for holiday checking

## Testing Scenarios

### Weekend Selection
1. Select Friday to Monday range
2. System shows: 4 total days, 2 working days, 2 holidays
3. Only 2 days deducted from leave balance

### Weekday Selection
1. Select Tuesday to Thursday range
2. System shows: 3 total days, 3 working days, 0 holidays
3. Full 3 days deducted from leave balance

### Holiday Warning
1. Select range including weekends
2. Visual warning appears with holiday count
3. Clear indication of non-working days included
