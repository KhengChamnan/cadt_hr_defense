# Leave Request Screen Improvements

## Overview
The leave request screen has been enhanced following Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to provide a better user experience.

## Applied Usability Heuristics

### ✅ 1. Visibility of System Status
- **Loading indicators**: App bar shows loading spinner during submission
- **Progress feedback**: Submit button shows "Submitting..." state
- **Form validation status**: Real-time feedback on form completion
- **Error states**: Clear display of submission failures with retry option

### ✅ 2. Match Between System and Real World
- **Familiar language**: Used clear terms like "Leave Request" instead of technical jargon
- **Intuitive icons**: Calendar icons for dates, wallet icon for balance
- **Natural flow**: Step-by-step process mirrors real-world leave request procedures

### ✅ 3. User Control and Freedom
- **Exit confirmation**: Warns users before discarding unsaved changes
- **Submission confirmation**: Review dialog before final submission
- **Cancel options**: Clear cancel buttons in all dialogs
- **Back button control**: Disabled during submission to prevent errors

### ✅ 4. Consistency and Standards
- **Consistent styling**: Using PalmColors and PalmTextStyles throughout
- **Standard UI patterns**: Familiar button styles, form layouts
- **Icon consistency**: Same icons used for similar actions

### ✅ 5. Error Prevention
- **Date validation**: Prevents past dates and invalid date ranges
- **Required field validation**: Checks for empty required fields
- **Minimum character requirements**: Ensures detailed reasons (min 10 chars)
- **Leave duration limits**: Warns about excessive leave requests (>30 days)
- **Balance checking**: Validates leave balance before submission

### ✅ 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- **Dropdown menus**: Leave types shown in dropdown instead of manual entry
- **Pre-filled data**: Profile information automatically populated
- **Default values**: Sensible defaults for dates and times
- **Balance display**: Shows current leave balance prominently

### ✅ 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- **Auto-calculations**: Automatically calculates leave days and hours
- **Smart defaults**: Pre-sets common working hours (8AM-5PM)
- **Quick validation**: Real-time feedback on form completion
- **Help access**: Quick help button in app bar

### ✅ 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- **Clean layout**: Organized sections with clear spacing
- **Focused content**: Only essential information displayed
- **Visual hierarchy**: Important information (balance) highlighted
- **Reduced clutter**: Grouped related information in cards

### ✅ 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
- **Clear error messages**: Specific, actionable error descriptions
- **Solution-oriented**: Error messages suggest how to fix issues
- **Error recovery**: Retry buttons and clear error state indicators
- **Contextual help**: Validation hints and character counters

### ✅ 10. Help and Documentation
- **Inline help**: Step-by-step instructions visible on screen
- **Help dialog**: Comprehensive help accessible from app bar
- **Usage tips**: Clear guidance on how to use each feature
- **Process explanation**: Shows approval workflow to users

## Key Improvements Made

### Enhanced Form Validation

// Before: Basic validation
if (_reasonController.text.trim().isEmpty) {
