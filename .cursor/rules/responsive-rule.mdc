# Responsive Flutter Components Rule

## Core Principles
- Always use relative sizing and flexible layout widgets
- Avoid hardcoded pixel values for width, height, padding, or margin
- Design components to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations

## Required Practices
- Use MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder, Flexible, and Expanded for adaptive layouts
- Test each component on multiple device sizes and orientations
- Break UI into small, reusable widgets with modular design
- Use Container, SizedBox, or similar widgets only with dynamic or proportional sizing
- Wrap content in SafeArea if near screen edges
- Use scalable units for text and icons (consider flutter_screenutil)

## Summary
Every component must be built and tested with responsiveness as a priority, using flexible layouts and relative sizingâ€”never fixed pixels.
