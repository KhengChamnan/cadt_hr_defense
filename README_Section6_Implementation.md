# Section 6: Implementation

## 6.1 Development Setup & Code Structure

The HR management system was implemented using a Flutter mobile application as the frontend, communicating with a Laravel backend API. The project follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns through a layered approach.

### Project Architecture

The Flutter application employs the Model-View-Provider (MVP) architecture pattern with the following key structural components:

- **Models**: Data structures representing business entities (Attendance, Leave, User, Approval)
- **Providers**: State management using the Provider package for reactive UI updates
- **Repositories**: Abstraction layer for data access with both Laravel and mock implementations
- **Screens**: UI components organized by feature (authentication, attendance, leave, approval)
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components for consistent design patterns
- **Services**: Utility services for location, camera, and PDF operations

### Repository Pattern Implementation

The system implements a Repository Factory pattern to enable seamless switching between production Laravel APIs and mock data sources for development and testing. This approach allows for independent frontend development while backend services are being developed. The factory creates appropriate repository instances based on configuration flags, supporting both integrated testing with live APIs and isolated testing with mock data.

### State Management Architecture

Provider pattern was implemented for state management, offering reactive programming capabilities where UI components automatically update when underlying data changes. Each feature domain (authentication, attendance, leave management) has dedicated providers that manage loading states, error handling, and data caching. The providers communicate with repositories through dependency injection, maintaining loose coupling between presentation and data layers.

## 6.2 Authentication Feature

### 6.2.1 Analysis & Design

The authentication system implements token-based authentication to secure API communications and manage user sessions. The technical approach involves credential validation against the Laravel backend, token storage in secure local storage, and role-based access control for different user types (employee, supervisor, manager).

**Sequence Diagram Description:**
1. User enters credentials in the login form
2. UI validates input fields locally
3. AuthProvider calls AuthRepository.login() with credentials
4. Repository sends HTTP POST request to Laravel `/auth/login` endpoint
5. Laravel validates credentials against database
6. If valid, Laravel returns JWT token and user information
7. Repository stores token in SharedPreferences for session persistence
8. AuthProvider updates authentication state
9. UI navigates to main application dashboard
10. For subsequent requests, stored token is included in Authorization headers

### 6.2.2 UX/UI Implementation

The authentication interface was implemented using Flutter widgets following the provided Figma designs. The sign-in screen features a Container with background image decoration for visual appeal. The form implementation utilizes a SignInBody widget containing TextFormField widgets for username and password input with appropriate validation.

Key implementation details include:
- Custom TextField styling with PalmColors theme consistency
- Form validation using Flutter's built-in validators
- Loading states managed through Provider pattern with conditional widget rendering
- Password visibility toggle implemented using IconButton with state management
- "Remember Me" functionality using Checkbox widget with SharedPreferences persistence
- Error message display through SnackBar widgets with themed styling

The authentication flow integrates biometric authentication capabilities using the `local_auth` package for enhanced security on supported devices.

### 6.2.3 User Flow & Interaction

The authentication user flow provides a streamlined login experience:

1. **Initial Load**: Application checks for stored credentials and displays auto-filled fields if "Remember Me" was previously enabled
2. **Credential Entry**: User enters username and password with real-time validation feedback
3. **Validation**: Form validates required fields and displays appropriate error messages for empty inputs
4. **Authentication**: Upon form submission, loading indicator appears while credentials are verified
5. **Success Handling**: Successful authentication stores the session token and navigates to the main dashboard
6. **Error Handling**: Authentication failures display user-friendly error messages without exposing system details
7. **Session Management**: Token expiration triggers automatic logout with redirection to login screen

## 6.3 Attendance Management Feature

### 6.3.1 QR Scanner Attendance

#### 6.3.1.1 Analysis & Design

The QR scanner attendance system combines QR code validation, GPS location verification, and timestamp recording to ensure accurate attendance tracking. The technical approach utilizes the device's camera for QR code scanning, GPS services for location validation, and real-time API communication for attendance submission.

**Sequence Diagram Description:**
1. User navigates to QR scanner from attendance menu
2. UI requests camera and location permissions
3. QR scanner overlay is displayed with custom frame
4. User scans QR code
5. QR decoder validates code format and content
6. If valid QR code, location service retrieves GPS coordinates
7. System validates location against office geofence boundaries
8. If location is valid, attendance data is prepared with timestamp
9. AttendanceProvider submits attendance to Laravel backend
10. Backend records attendance with status toggle (in/out)
11. Success response triggers navigation to success screen
12. Attendance history is refreshed to reflect new entry

#### 6.3.1.2 UX/UI Implementation

The QR scanner interface was implemented using the `qr_code_scanner_plus` package with custom overlay design. The scanner screen features a black background with a centered scanning frame created using CustomPainter for precise corner indicators.

Implementation specifics:

2. **Scanner Activation**: Camera preview loads with scanning overlay and instruction text
3. **QR Code Detection**: Automatic detection and processing of QR codes within the scanning frame
4. **Code Validation**: Valid attendance QR codes proceed to location verification
5. **Location Verification**: GPS coordinates are validated against office boundaries
6. **Attendance Submission**: Successful validation submits attendance with current timestamp
7. **Status Update**: Attendance status alternates between check-in and check-out automatically
8. **Confirmation Screen**: Success page displays attendance confirmation with time details
9. **Error Handling**: Invalid QR codes or location failures display retry options
